# Enhanced Animated Components

A curated collection of beautiful animated UI components sourced from popular libraries like Aceternity UI, Magic UI, HeroUI, Animate UI, and React Bits. Each component has been enhanced with small but meaningful improvements that I found useful as a developer and thought others might benefit from too.

## 🎯 Purpose

While building projects, I often found myself making small tweaks to animated components from various libraries - adding a missing prop here, improving accessibility there, or fixing a small bug. This repository collects those enhanced versions so other developers can benefit from these improvements without having to make the same modifications.

Common enhancements include:
- Missing props
- Improved accessibility
- Performance optimizations
- Bug fixes
- Additional customization options

## 🚀 Features

- **Copy-Paste Ready**: All components are designed to be copied directly into your project
- **Beautiful Animations**: Focus on visually stunning animated components
- **Enhanced Functionality**: Small improvements that make components more developer-friendly
- **Clear Documentation**: Simple usage examples and what's been enhanced
- **Production Ready**: All components are tested and optimized
